# Chess3D
SFML / OpenGL project for a 3D chess game

## Requirements 

This project runs on OpenGL (which should be installed on your machine). In addition, here are a few libraries that used :

| Library                            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AntTweakBar-1.16                   | A lightweight GUI library for adding tweakable UI controls to OpenGL apps. |
| assimp-3.0.1270                    | A library to import and export 3D model formats like OBJ, FBX, and COLLADA.|
| bullet-2.81-rev2613                | A physics engine for simulating rigid body dynamics and collision detection.|
| glew-1.13.0                        | The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library — helps manage OpenGL extensions.    |
| rpavlik-cmake-modules-fe2273      | A set of CMake modules to simplify project configuration and build setup.  |
| SFML                               | The Simple and Fast Multimedia Library — provides graphics, audio, and input support for C++. |


These libraries should be place in the "external" folder of the project directory.
